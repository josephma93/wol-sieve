## Disclaimer

This tool is intended for personal use only. The use of this tool must comply with the terms and conditions of the WOL.
Users are prohibited from redistributing, using the content for commercial purposes, or posting the content on any other
site. Please review the WOL's Terms and Conditions of Use before using this tool to ensure compliance.

## Environment Variables

You can configure `wol-sieve` using the following environment variables:

- `NODE_ENV`: Sets the environment mode. Should be set to `production` in a production environment (default:
  `production`).
- `WS_PORT`: Specifies the port the web server listens on (default: `3389`).
- `WS_LOG_LEVEL`: Defines the log level. Accepted values are `info`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`, etc. (default: `info`).

These variables can be passed when running the Docker container directly with the `-e` option or through the
`docker-compose.yml` file, as shown in the example.

## Docker Installation

You can also run `wol-sieve` as a Docker container, which simplifies the setup and ensures consistent behavior across
different environments. Follow the steps below to install and run `wol-sieve` using Docker:

### Pulling the Docker Image

To get the latest version of the `wol-sieve` Docker image, pull it from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker pull joesofteng/wol-sieve:latest
```

### Running the Docker Container

Once you have the image, you can run it using the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name wol-sieve -p 3389:3389 joesofteng/wol-sieve
```

This command will start the `wol-sieve` container in detached mode (`-d`), exposing port `3389` as defined in the
`Dockerfile`.

### Running with Specific Environment Variables

You can also configure the behavior of `wol-sieve` using the following environment variables:

- `NODE_ENV`: Defines the environment mode (`production` by default).
- `WS_PORT`: Specifies the port the application listens on (default: `3389`).
- `WS_LOG_LEVEL`: Sets the logging level (`info`, `warn`, `error`, etc.; default: `info`).

Hereâ€™s how you can run the Docker container while overriding some of these environment variables:

```bash
docker run -d --name wol-sieve -e NODE_ENV=development -e WS_PORT=8080 -e WS_LOG_LEVEL=debug -p 8080:8080 joesofteng/wol-sieve
```

In this example:

- The app is run in `development` mode.
- The port `8080` is exposed instead of the default `3389`.
- The log level is set to `debug`.

### Stopping and Removing the Container

To stop the running container:

```bash
docker stop wol-sieve
```

To remove the container:

```bash
docker rm wol-sieve
```

## Docker Compose Example

You can also use `docker-compose` to manage `wol-sieve`. Below is a sample `docker-compose.yml` file that starts the
service:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  wol-sieve:
    image: joesofteng/wol-sieve:latest
    container_name: wol-sieve
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - WS_PORT=3389
      - WS_LOG_LEVEL=info
    ports:
      - "3389:3389"
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Starting the Service with Docker Compose

Once you have the `docker-compose.yml` file, you can start the service by running:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will start the `wol-sieve` service in detached mode.

### Stopping the Service

To stop the service, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This command will stop and remove the `wol-sieve` container.
